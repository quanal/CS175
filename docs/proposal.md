Summary of the Project: (30 points)
Our work focuses on the natural language interface.  Most items focus on retrieving user’s commands, analyze iit via AI algorithms, and reflect via agent’s actions in the game.
For the framework, it may be provided by professor, or we’ll built the simple framework just enough for demonstrating the AI algorithms via agent.
For the Minecraft Project we will focus on natural language interface. The main idea of this project is for our agent to execute actions based on commands entered by the user. The input will consist of the text command and the data structure representing the environment of the world in minecraft. Since we are mostly focusing in classifying the text, we will work with a simple Minecraft world. However, as the project progresses then we will add more complexity to the world. One of the main goals is for the agent to be able to distinguish between a verb and a subject when given a command. It is important for our agent to classify these two components within a sentence in order for it to execute the action. Most of the actions will include the agent to move to different places in the environment and to be able to identify the objects in its surroundings. This will require an  algorithm to find the shortest path to the objects. The output will consist of a set of actions that our agent will perform for each command given by the user.
