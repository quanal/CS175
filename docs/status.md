Project summery: Our project is using Natural Languale Processing to command the AI agent what to do. We use Deterministic Finite State machine to classify the command out of any other statement or questions that the user put to the AI agent. The goal of our project is the AI agent be able to execute the command from simple to complex such as: go to the tree, go and cut the tree, or find the house, go behind the nearest tree...
