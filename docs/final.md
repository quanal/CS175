## Project Summary

<h4>Environment</h4>

<ul><b>These materials have been used in this project to create the environment and all items, blocks, and entities:</b>
  <li>Tutorial 5</li>
  <li>craft_work.py</li>
  <li>Homework assignments: 1 and 2</li>
  <li>Malmo xml schemas via this link https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/Schemas/Types.xsd</li>
</ul>
