## Project Summary

<h4>Environment</h4>

<ul><b>These materials have been used in this project to create the environment and all items, blocks, and entities:</b>
  <li>Tutorial 5</li>
  <li>craft_work.py</li>
  <li>Homework assignments: 1 and 2</li>
  <li>Malmo xml schemas via this link https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo/blob/master/Schemas/Types.xsd</li>
</ul>

As a initial plan, we need an environemnt with maze with air as gaps (to apply the finding shortest paths), and all other items added onto that same maze.  On the move to the final state, we did the following steps:

Build up the environment with various types of objects:

Built up a maze with size of 80x80, with gap, walls surrounded
